Here i have given dataset in csv file which i have used in below program and we carefull about setting the path of dataset 
we can do two things to get rid off that problem
1)copy the path of dataset and paste it in dataset=pd.read_csv('path/datasetname.csv')
2)save the program in same location where is our dataset is present
