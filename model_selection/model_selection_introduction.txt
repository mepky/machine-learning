#Here in model selection section we learn which model we have to use for good accuracy 



#Grid search 
It works to find the best way that is which parameter should be used and what should be the kernel value like that thing
for achive higher accurecy


#K-fold cross validation
This is best classification algorithm for high achive algorithm
